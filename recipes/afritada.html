    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Afritada is a Philippine dish consisting of chicken, beef, or pork braised in tomato sauce with carrots, potatoes, and red and green bell peppers.</p>
    <p> It is served on white rice and is a common Filipino meal. It can also be cooked with seafood.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Aromatics- sauteed onions and garlic boost the flavor</li>
        <li>Chicken- Bone-in chicken works best in this recipe, bringing a deeper flavor. If you prefer boneless, choose thigh fillets, as the breast can turn dry and chewy in the slow cooking process.
        </li>
        <li>Roma Tomatoes- use ripe tomatoes as they're sweeter and juicier</li>
        <li>Vegetables- potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, and sweet peas extend servings and add color and texture. 
        </li>
        <li>Fish sauce- adds umami taste</li>
        <li>Water- use more or less depending on the amount of sauce preferred. You can also use chicken broth for extra depth.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper- salt enhances the dish's flavor, and pepper adds zing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown potatoes and carrots in hot oil. Remove and set aside. Saute bell peppers until lightly browned. Remove from pan and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Add onions and garlic and cook until softened. Add chicken and lightly brown.</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes and cook until softened and release juice. Add fish sauce and simmer for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add water and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, cover, and cook until the chicken is tender and the sauce slightly reduces. Add potatoes and carrots and continue to cook until fork-tender.</li>
        <li>Add bell peppers and sweet peas and cook until heated through and tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Continue to simmer until the sauce is thickened to the desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>
